A modern real-time chat app with MySQL

🚀 Why I Built ChatBud

I wanted to create a real-time chat experience that feels smooth, modern, and reliable. Instead of just going with the usual NoSQL databases, I challenged myself to make it work with MySQL — because it brings structure, reliability, and clear relationships for handling users, messages, and conversations.

Think of ChatBud as my way of showing:

I understand backend logic and database design.

I can manage real-time communication using WebSockets.

I can build something that’s both scalable and user-friendly.

🛠 Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Database: MySQL

Real-time: Socket.IO

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with a pixel-theme inspired UI ✨)

⚡ Features

✅ User authentication – secure login/signup
✅ 1-to-1 chat – send and receive instantly
✅ Real-time messaging – powered by Socket.IO
✅ Message history – stored in MySQL for persistence
✅ Clean UI – simple, pixel-themed design

🧩 How It Works

Login / Signup → Users are authenticated and stored in MySQL.

Chat Rooms / Direct Chat → Each conversation is handled through Socket.IO channels.

Message Storage → Every message is stored in MySQL with sender/receiver references.

Instant Updates → The frontend updates live without refreshing.
